# Drops-cringe-text-adventure

Just a small text based adventure game.

You fight enemies, collect treasure, upgrade your items, stuff like that.

# Classes

Warrior: increases attack

Ranger: quicker on your feet

Mage: increases healing

Engineer: builds sentries

Merchant: decreases shop prices


# Enemies & Scaling

Enemies and most enemy stats are randomized. There are the basic enemies, and then there are slightly more challenging ones. 

Some fights only become accessible by leveling up, such as boss monsters.

You gain xp by killing enemies. With enough xp you gain a level. The more levels you have, the tougher fights become. 

You can buy a difficulty modifier in the shop to add an additional increase in enemy stats.
